# Steamworks Foundation

_Steamworks Foundation_ is the "lite" version of the [Steamworks Complete](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/steamworks-v2-complete-190316) Unity asset and an extension of the work done by [Riley Labrecque](https://github.com/rlabrecque) on [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) and is dependent on it. This asset will check for the presence of [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) and offer to install it in your Unity project for you via Unity's Package Mannager if it is missing.

Please consider supporting [Riley Labrecque](https://github.com/rlabrecque) and [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) here on GitHub you can find Sponsor links on his pages.

_Steamworks Foundation_ is compatable with PC, Mac and Linux based Unity projects and does work with IL2CPP.
